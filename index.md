# **Muhammad Asad Imran**



## *Intro*
> "And the dirt that they threw on my name turned to soil and I grew up out it" ~ Drake
 
 This quote is from one of my favorite artists and I chose to include it because I feel I've always had a chip on my shoulder and I have something to prove. 

 I was given the name Muhammad by my parents as it is tradition in my culture to name the first born son Muhammad, but I go by my middle name Asad, which translates to lion in Arabic. 

 I was born in Torrance, California but moved to Laguna Niguel when I was 3 and have been there since. I graduated from Dana Hills High School in 2019 and have attended UCSD since 2019 as well. I major in Computer Science and Engineering.

## **Academics and professional career **
In the summer of 2021, I took part in my first internship at a small computer network company called *Mibura Inc*. I was a developer and also assisted in operational efforts. 

I was the head of a a very small team (3 people) for a relatively simple project. We impletented a search engine for data centers around the globe. We integrated multiple search APIs and a static SQL database to search. The finished product was a web application were we querie a region in the world and the engine outputted a list of data centers in or near that region. 

I still don't know exactly what I want to do with my career, but that's why I am here. I hope to find my calling within my time at UCSD. 

Some of my objectives to complete for my time at UCSD include: 
-[x] keep above a 3.5 GPA
-[] find out what my passion is and what I really would love to do for the rest of my life
-[] develop a great network that will supply me with connections for life. 


## **Code**
My favoite keyword in code would probably have to be the 'new' keyword in C++
I think the distinction between the stack and heap is very intersting because it gives us a way to classify memory.
